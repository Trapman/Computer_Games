'''Two-player board game played on an 8x8 grid, using tiles that are black and white (we will use X and O instead for sake
of brevity, so we will use Cartesian Coordinates and a computer AI.

Two players take turns placing tiles of their chosen color on the board. When a player faces a tile on the board, any of the
opponent's tiles that are between the new tile and the other tiles of the player's color are flipped. E.g., if white player
has a tile at (5,4) and places a new tiles on space (5,6), if there is a black tile at (5,5) then it becomes a white tile.
Tiles in all directions are flipped as long as they are between the player's new tile and an existing tile of that color.'''
