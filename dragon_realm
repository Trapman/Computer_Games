'''Premise: game in which the player decides between two caves, which hold either treasure or certain doom

The play is in a land full of dragons. All dragons live in caves with sultan-like treasures. Some dragons are friendly and 
will share their treasure with the player, while other dragons will kill the player upon entering the cave. The player has 
to decide between two caves. The challenge is that the player does not know what kind of dragon he will encounter in either of
the caves

We'll make use of a few different tools and techniques here:

(1) flowcharts                            (8) global/local variable scope
(2) def functions                         (9) parameters and arguments
(3) multiline strings                     (10) sleep() function
(4) while statements
(5) and / or Boolean operators
(6) truth tables
(7) return keyword

basically a visualization of what happens in each step. Helps keep everything in place especially when things gets complex.
