#use Cartesian coordinate system 
#data strutures: it has list values that contain other lists and similar complex variables. 
#as games get more complicated, you'll need to organize  your data into data structures. 
#TOPICS: data structures, pythagorean theorem, remove() list method, isdigit() string method, sys.exit() methd
#3 chests to collect, player has 20 sonar devices to use to find them. 
#Sonar devices produce a 'ring' and can only find the distance from the chest, not the chest's direction.
#Chests can be anywhere on the ring around the sonar device. 
#Multiple sonar devices working together can narrow down the chest's location to the exact coordinates where the rings intersect.
#basically we use Cartesian coordinates to choose where we drop the sonar devices

#(1): Import Modules:
#sys contains exit() function; math module has sqrt function
import random
import sys
import math

#(2): Creating a new Game Board:
#each time we start a new game, need to create a new board data structure, which is created by getNewBoard()
#the board is created in ASCII art with x- and y-coordinates around it. 
#board is accessed in the same way we access Cartesian coordinates; so to get coordinate (26,12) we use board[26][12]
#board is a lis of lists of strings: the first list represents the x-coord, and will contain 60 lists across. We create a for loop that will apend 60 blank lists to it
#each of the 60 lists represent an x-coord; there are also 15 rows so each of the 60 lists must contain 15 strings.
#we add another for loop to add 15 single-character strings
#the oceans is a bunch of randomly choose '~' and '`' strings. Use random.randint() to randomly choose them
#if random.randit() is 0 then we use `~`, otherwise (i.e. it is 1) we use '`'
#then use return to return the vale in the board variable once we have done all of this
def getNewBoards():
  #Create a new 60x15 board data structure
  board = []
  for x in range(60):         #the main list is a list of 60 lists
    board.append([])
    for y in range(15):       #each list in the main list has 15 single-character strings. Use diff characters to make ocean look more readable.
      if random.randomint(0,1) == 0:
        board[x].append('~')
      else:
        board[x].append('`')
  return board

#(3) Drawing the Game Board
#we will define the drawBoard() method that we can call whenever we need to draw a new board as the game progresses
#basically it will have 4 steps:
#i: create a string variable of the line with 1,2,3,4,5 spaced out with wide gapes. These numbers mark the coordinates for 10,20,30,40,50 on the x-axis
#ii: use that string to display x-coordinates along the top of the screen
#iii: print each row of the ocean along with the y-coordinates on both sides of the screen
#iv: print the x-axis again at the bottom. Having coordinates on all sides makes it easier to see where to place a sonar device.

#(4) Drawing the X-Coordinates Along the Top of the Board:
#first part of drawBoard() prints the x-axis at the top of the board.
#each coordinate can only take up a single digit, so when the coordinate number reaches 10, we put the digits in the tens place on a seperate line
#this will create the tens part of the board
#the next part basically skips 9 spaces and then places a number between 1 and 5 at each interval
def drawBoard(board):
  #Draw the board data structure
  tensDigitLine = '    ' #initial space for the numbers down the left side of the board
  for i in range(1, 6):
    tensDigitLine += (' ' * 9) + str(i)
    
  #Print numbers across the top of the board
  print(tensDigitsLine)
  print('    ' + ('0123456789' * 6))
  print()
 
#(5) Drawing the Ocean:
#the for lopp prints rows 0 to 14 on the y-axis
#since we rows 0-9 will take up 1 space while rows 10-14 will take up 2 space, we need a way to make it all even.
#the if row < 10 logic will resolve this and add an extra space if 10, 11, 12, 13, or 14 so everything lines up
  #Print each of the 15 rows
  for row in range(15):
    #single digit numbers nee to be padded with an extra space
    if row < 10:
      extraSpace = ' '
    else:
      extraSpace = ''
 
#(6) Printing a Row in the Ocean:
#so boardRow starts a a blank string, then the for loop above sets the row variable for the current row of ocean waves to print
#inside this for loop, is another for loop that iterates over each column for the current row
#boardRow is created by concatenating board[column][row] in this loop
#basically by concatenating board[0][row], board[1][row], board[2][row]...board[59][row] since we have range(60)
#then the string in boardRow is printed along with the row numbers using %s
    #Create the string for this row on the board
    boardRow = ''
    for column in range(60):
      boardRow += board[column][row]
    
    print('%s%s %s %s' % (extraSpace, row, boardRow, row))    
  
#(7) Drawing X-Coordinates Along the Bottom of the Board:
#similr to above
  #print the numbers across the bottom of the board
  print()
  print('    ' + ('123456789' * 6))
  print(tensDigitsLine)
  
#(8) Creating the Random Treasure Chests 
#we make the game to randomly decide where the chests are, represented as a list of lists of two integers
#e.g. the data structure could be something like: [[2,4], [10, 31], [5, 9]]
#getRandomChests() will create a certain number of chest data structures and randomly assign them to different coordinates
#numChests will tell the function how many chests to create
#the while loop will continue until ll the chests have been created
#two random integers will be selected from the x- and y-coordinates, which will evaluate to a list value like [3,8] etc
#if these coordinates do not already exist, they get appended to 'chests'
def getRandomChests(numChests):
  #create a list of chest data structures (two-item lists of x, y int coordinates)
  chests = []
  while len(chests) < numChests:
    newChest = [random.randint(0, 59), random.randint(0, 14)]
    if newChest not in chests:         #makes sure a chest is not already here
      chests.append(newChest)
  return chests

#(9) Determining Whether a Move is Valid:
#x-coord must be between 0-59, y-coord must be between 0-14
#we just use a simple expression to combine all of this stuff
def isOnBoard(x, y):
  #return True if the coordinates are on the board; otherwise, return False.
  return x >= 0 and x<= 59 and y >= 0 and y <= 14

#(10) Placing a Move on the Board:
#update the game board to display a number that represents each sonar device's distance to the closest treasure chest
#so the board changes based upon the positions of the chests
#the makeMove() function takes in 4 parameters
def makeMove(board, chests, x, y):
  #change the board data structure with a sonar device character.
  #remove treasure chests from the chest list if they are found.
  #return False if this is an invalid move.
  #otherwise, return the string of the result of this move.
  for cx, cy in chests:
    distance = math.sqrt((cx - x) * (cx - x) + (cy - y) * (cy -y)
    
    if distance < smallestDistance:      #we want the closest treasure chest
      smallestDistance = distance
      
  smallestDistance = round(smallestDistance)
  
  if smallestDistance == 0:
    # xy is directly on a treasure chest
    chests.remove([x, y])
    return 'You have found a sunken treasure chest!'
  else:
    if smallDistance < 10:
      board[x][y] = str(smallestDistance)
      return 'Treasure detected at a distance of %s from the sonar device.' % (smallestDistance)
      
    else:
      board[x][y] = 'X'
      return 'Sonar did not detect anything. All treasure chests out of range.'
