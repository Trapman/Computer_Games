**To open the debugger in the interactive shell, click Debug-->Debugger**<br/>
-In IDLE, open any .py file<br/>
-Be sure to select the Stack, Locals, Source, and Globals checkboxes. <br/>
-Now when you attempt to run a program and click F5, the program will run under the debugger. <br/>
-You can stpe through the program now and work through it line by line to see exactly what's going on. <br/>

**Three types of errors**<br/>
(1) Syntax: from typos.<br/>
(2) Runtime: occur when the programs is running. Program will work up until this point and then will crash.<br/>
(3) Semantic: probably the most tricky to find. They don't crash the program, but will prevent it from doing what you intended it to do. <br/>

Infinite loops: just press `control-C`<br/>


**Stepping through a program with debugger:**<br/>
-The debugger allows you to execute one instruction at a time; this process is called 'stepping.'<br/>
-just click the **Step** button.<br/>
