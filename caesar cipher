'''Converts normal English into a secret code. It can also convert secret codes back into regular English. 
   Only someone that knows the key to the secret codes will be able to understand the messages.
   
   The Caeser Ciper works by replacing each letter in it with a SHIFTED letter. E.g. if you shift A by 1, you get B, if you shift
   B by 3, you get E, and so forth. 
   
   So if we set the key = 3, then each letter will be shifted by 3.
