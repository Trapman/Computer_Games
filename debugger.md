**To open the debugger in the interactive shell, click Debug-->Debugger**<br/>
-In IDLE, open any .py file<br/>
-Be sure to select the Stack, Locals, Source, and Globals checkboxes.

**Three types of errors**
(1) Syntax: from typos.
(2) Runtime: occur when the programs is running. Program will work up until this point and then will crash.
(3) Semantic: probably the most tricky to find. They don't crash the program, but will prevent it from doing what you inteted it to do. 

Infinite loops: just press `control-C`


**Stepping through a program with debugger:**
-The debugger allows you to execute one instruction at a time; this process is called 'stepping.'
-just click the **Step** button.
