#3 chests to collect, player has 20 sonar devices to use to find them. 
#Sonar devices produce a 'ring' and can only find the distance from the chest, not the chest's direction.
#Chests can be anywhere on the ring around the sonar device. 
#Multiple sonar devices working together can narrow down the chest's location to the exact coordinates where the rings intersect.
#basically we use Cartesian coordinates to choose where we drop the sonar devices.
